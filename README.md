jquery-autotab
==============

A lightly modified version of Matthew Miller's jQuery Autotab:

After tabbing over to the next relevant field, I wanted to make sure that 
any pre-populated text would be automatically selected to make it easier to clear out and edit.
To do so, I added an quick modification to line 260.
